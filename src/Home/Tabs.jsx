                                is not very difficult to write a program that solves a problem that you can solve
                                yourself. The skill you need to acquire is thinking very precisely about how you
                                solve the problem and breaking it down into steps that are so simple that a computer
                                can execute them. I encourage you to first solve a few instances of a problem by
                                hand and think about what you did to find the solution. For example if the task is
                                sorting lists, sort some short lists yourself.</p>

                                list. Then you have to teach the computer 1) how to find the smallest element, 2)
                                how to write it down, 3) how to cross it out, and wrap this in a loop. Then continue
